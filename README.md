# Reinforcement Learning
Learning from interaction is a foundational idea underlying nearly all theories of learning and intelligence.
Funadamental idea in reinforcement learning is:
- learning what to do
  - how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward
- a learner is not told which actions to take
  - must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them
